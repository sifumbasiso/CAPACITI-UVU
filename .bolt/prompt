Project Title: CAPACITI AI Chatbot
Project Overview:
The goal of this project is to develop an AI-powered chatbot that can answer user queries about CAPACITI. The chatbot should provide accurate, real-time responses based on company information, services, programs, and other relevant details.
Project Objectives:
1.	Develop an AI chatbot that interacts with users in natural language.
2.	Ensure the chatbot can provide relevant and up-to-date information about CAPACITI.
3.	Implement user-friendly features such as text-based and voice-based interactions.
4.	Support multiple question types, including FAQs, program details, and general inquiries.
5.	Store and analyze chat interactions for future improvements.
6.	Integrate a document containing CAPACITI's information for the chatbot to retrieve and respond to queries.
Core Features:
1.	Natural Language Processing (NLP): The chatbot should understand and process user queries using AI techniques.
2.	AI-Powered Responses: The chatbot should retrieve and generate accurate answers from a predefined document containing CAPACITI's information.
3.	Document-Based Knowledge Retrieval: Instead of web scraping, the chatbot should rely on a structured document to provide up-to-date and verified responses.
4.	Multi-Channel Support: The chatbot should work on different platforms such as a website, mobile app, or messaging apps.
5.	User Authentication (Optional): Allow users to sign up or log in for personalized interactions.
6.	Logging & Analytics: Record user interactions to improve chatbot responses over time.
7.	Admin Dashboard: A simple interface for updating company information and monitoring chatbot performance.
8.	Voice Interaction (Optional): Support for text-to-speech and speech-to-text for accessibility.
9.	Brand Consistency: The chatbot's design and color scheme must align with CAPACITI's official brand colors for a professional and cohesive look.
Technical Requirements:
1.	Programming Languages: Python (FastAPI, Flask) or JavaScript (Node.js, Express.js).
2.	AI Integration: OpenAI API or other NLP libraries such as spaCy or Rasa.
3.	Database: Firebase, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB for storing FAQs and user interactions.
4.	Document Processing: Utilize PDF, JSON, or a structured text file to store and retrieve CAPACITI's information.
5.	Frontend (if applicable): React, Vue.js, or a chatbot widget integrated into a website.
6.	Hosting & Deployment: Cloud-based services like AWS, Azure, or Firebase.
7.	Security: Implement basic security measures to prevent abuse (e.g., rate limiting, authentication).
Development Phases:
1.	Research & Planning: Gather information about CAPACITI and define chatbot scope.
2.	Design & Prototyping: Create conversation flows and UI wireframes.
3.	Development: Build and train the chatbot using AI tools.
4.	Testing & Debugging: Ensure chatbot accuracy and fix any issues.
5.	Deployment: Launch the chatbot on the selected platforms.
6.	Maintenance & Updates: Continuously improve responses and features based on user feedback.
Deliverables:
•	AI chatbot with functional NLP capabilities.
•	CAPACITI knowledge base stored in a structured document for chatbot responses.
•	Documentation detailing chatbot usage and maintenance.
•	A presentation or demo showcasing chatbot functionality.
Evaluation Criteria:
